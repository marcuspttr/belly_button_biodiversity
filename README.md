# belly_button_biodiversity
Using javascript to look at the diverse world of bacteria in our belly buttons.

Another hard assignment! Again I got a lot of work done at the beginning, but then came grinding to a halt.

## Some issues:
- Struggled to even get the samples.json file to read before trying the python -m http.server fix.
- Setting up the intial drop down menu was tricky. Was good practice using d3 to integrate parts of the html file.
- In general everything was loosely based off the exercises we had done in class, but took a bit of fiddling and a bit of thinking to get it to work correctly in this context.
- Specifically filtering was a challenge. Reading the object file was a bnit different.
- Once I got the data making the graphs was actually pretty easy.
- The final hurdle I struggled with was creating the demographics table with the meta data. I'm pretty sure I could have written a arrow function and a map to append to the table, but my simple for loop worked just as well.

## Final thoughts:
I'm happy with how it looks. Ran out of time to do the bonus, and although I hosted it on github, it's not very happy with reading the json file now.  Something else for me to fix!
